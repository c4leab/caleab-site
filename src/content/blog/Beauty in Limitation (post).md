One time, I was trying out a digital todo-list software. It was great. It had the bells and whistles: grouping todo-lists, scheduling them, reminders about todos, setting up recurring todos, calendar integration etc. I had one problem, though, whenever I used it, I never got anything done. 

This obviously defeats the purpose of the app, so I tried to figure out exactly that was. My first thought was that I wasn't using it properly, so i researching and experimented. I tried some techniques such as the Eisenhower Matrix,  Pomodoro, grouping my todo's in different ways and more. Nothing worked. 

Eventually, out of habit, I found myself using sticky notes more than my super-capable todo-list software. It was after I realized why I was using sticky notes that I figured out my point. They had three things
1. It were quick
2. It were intuitive
3. It were limited. 

It were quick because all I had to do was pull them out and write whatever. I never had to open up some software, wait for it to load, and apply meta-data such as tags to it. 

It was intuitive because of it's simplicity. Write down a task, then cross it out once you finish it. [Simple as that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxc63Sc1sMg). 

It was limited in that it didn't have folders, matrixs, tags, integrations etc. Also you can't just write an infinite amount of tasks on a sticky note. I found this to be the most important factor. It forced me to pick out tasks I actually had to do instead of just stockpiling on things I wanted to do. There's only so much time in a day, so that helped weed out the non-priority tasks. 

It was after that I realized the beauty of limitations. Sometimes less is more. 

I was going to waffle some more but I'll cut it there.
