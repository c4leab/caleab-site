At some point in my life, I realized that life is kind of long.

The usual consensus is that life is short, which I understand looking retrospectively. Looking prospectively, though, when you’re young and have 50+ years of life looking at you (if all goes well)— it’s kind of long.

Once that realization settled, I figured that there’s no quick way to reach success in life.

Health, what is required for life, requires ongoing maintenance. Wealth, requires maintenance. Relationships, require maintenance. There is no end goal to those events, you must keep working on them or else they’ll disappear.

I transitioned from thinking of life as a sprint — “if I do x as fast as possible, then I’ll achieve fulfillment” — to thinking of life as a marathon — “If I continually make sustainable progress on important areas of my life, then I’ll be content throughout the length of my existent.”
