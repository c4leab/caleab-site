I’ve been meaning to try to learn how to use terminal for 3 reasons:

1. It’s far more efficient to navigate and manage files with
2. I’ll eventually have to use it in my software development journey. I don’t want to rely on graphical interfaces to do things like pulling and pushing to GitHub
3. It looks and feels cool using it.

I have this habit of starting things, making some progress, forgetting about them, finding them again and repeating the process. I had already gone through the cycle once so I’m hoping by documenting my journey, I don’t forget about it again.

Right now my main goal is just to be comfortable using terminal for common computer activities such as navigating directories, downloading and uninstalling applications/files, and using Git and GitHub with it (less common).

In my last run I got some Idea of what terminal is and learned for basic commands and terminal shortcuts.

## What is Terminal?

Terminal is a command-line interface that allows you to control your computer using text commands instead of a graphical interface (e.g., clicking on buttons). Computers started off as command-line interfaces before becoming [graphical](https://verpex.com/blog/website-tips/gui-vs-cli).

## Why use Terminal?

- It’s faster and more powerful than the GUI (graphical user interface)
- It’s important for programming
- It unlocks hidden aspects of your computer

## Basic Terminal Commands

```
pwd :: print current directory
ls :: list files and folders in the current directory
cd <folder> :: Change directory
cd .. :: move up one directory level
mkdir <name> :: create new folder
touch <file> :: create new file 
rm <file> :: delete a file
rmdir <folder> :: delete and empty folder
rm -r <folder> :: delete a folder and its contents 
clear :: clear the Terminal screen
exit :: close the Terminal session
```

## Terminal Shortcuts

To be honest, the shortcuts I found weren’t really working. I’ll just learn shortcuts the way I learn shortcuts for other apps — by doing something so routinely that I ask myself if there is a shortcut for it, then replacing the action with the shortcut.
